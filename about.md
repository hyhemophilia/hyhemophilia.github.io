1.Individual chatting, wishes  copy paste of general jokes, videos, cartoons, good morning/night messages should be avoided in group.   
2.Any negative comment on religion, community, political party should not be posted because indirectly we may hurt others. 
3. Verify authenticity of message when circulating messages for good cause. Pls don't not circulate spam and fake offers.
4. If you do not like or have objection on any post, express one to one.
